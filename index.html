          Flowers are the reproductive organs of plants, designed to attract
          pollinators like insects and birds. They come in a wide variety of
          colors, shapes, and scents. The structure of a typical flower includes
          colorful petals, stamens that produce pollen (the male part), and a
          pistil containing the ovary (the female part) that holds the ovules.
          Flowers are essential not only for pollination and reproduction but
          also as symbols of beauty in nature, and they are widely used for
          decoration, symbolism, and in cultural rituals.
